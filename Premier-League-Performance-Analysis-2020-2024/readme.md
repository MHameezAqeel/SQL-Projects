# Premier League Performance Analysis (2020-2024)

## Project Overview
This project explores the performance of Premier League teams between 2020 and 2024. Key performance indicators such as xG (expected goals), goals scored, goals conceded, and formations were analyzed to derive insights into team consistency, efficiency, and strategies.

## Tools Used
- **MS SQL Server** for data analysis and querying
- **Excel** for basic data cleaning

## Key Insights
1. **Most Consistent Team**: Based on variance in xG, goals scored, and goals conceded, [Team X] had the most consistent performance across the seasons.
2. **Best Formations**: The 4-2-3-1 formation consistently produced the highest average xG and goals scored.
3. **Efficiency in Shots**: Teams with fewer but more accurate shots on target tended to have a higher win probability.

## SQL Queries
You can find the SQL queries used in the analysis in the `Premier-League-Performance-Analysis-2020-2024` directory.

## Data Source
The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle] and includes match statistics from the 2020-2024 Premier League seasons.
